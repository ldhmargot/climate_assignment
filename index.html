			There’s always a good reason to give in to our sweet tooth. Having a bad day? Have some chocolate. Celebrating your birthday? Have a nice cake. A little thirsty? Have a refreshing soda. Globally, this has led to staggering consumptions of sugar, the main ingredient in all these foods.  Over the past decade alone, global sugar consumption has grown from <a href="https://www.wcrf.org/sites/default/files/Curbing-Global-Sugar-Consumption.pdf" target="_blank">130 to 178 million tonnes</a>, meaning the average person in the world ingested <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/" target="_blank">22kg of sugar</a> in 2019, which is about 2.5 times the <a href=" https://www.cbsnews.com/news/world-health-organization-lowers-sugar-intake-recommendations/ 
			" target="_blank"> WHO recommended limit for sugar</a>. And in some countries, sugar intake is much higher, <a href=" https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/02/05/where-people-around-the-world-eat-the-most-sugar-and-fat/ 
			" target="_blank">the U.S. being in the lead</a> with 46kg of sugar consumed per person per year, closely followed by European countries, Australia, Mexico and Canada. Which is why the sugar business is so attractive: sugarcane (which provide <a href=" https://www.iisd.org/system/files/publications/ssi-global-market-report-sugar.pdf 
			" target="_blank"> 86% </a> of the world’s sugar) is the most popular crop to grow in the world; and also one of the most lucrative: in 2017, cane sugar had an export value of $23.7 billion. And interestingly, sugarcane growers all seem to follow the same user guide:

" target="_blank"> 4 million hectares </a> of land have been acquired in large-scale deals, from small-scale farmers, to grow sugarcane - and in some cases, these have been associated with human rights and land violation.   </br> </br>The birth of the sugar industry in Cambodia is fraught with land grabbing. During the civil war, the Khmer Rouge banned private property and burned land records. Despite government efforts, 90% of Cambodians still do not hold deeds  to the land on which they are currently living. To boost exports, the government granted Economic Land Concessions to the private sector, which have been abused and led to the displacement of more than <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/europe-blood-sugar-cambodia-human-rights-trade/" target="_blank"> 10,000 people. </a>  </br> </br> Brazil, which accounts for 50% of all cane sugar exports, has also seen its fair share of land conflicts, many of whose are linked to indigenous land rights. And in 2020, President Bolsonaro allowed the <a href=" https://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/brazil-sugarcane-rush-poses-new-threat-amazon-rainforest

				Many of the largest producers of cane sugar are propped up by migrant workers doing difficult, menial, and low-paid work. </br></br>In 1952, the Dominican Republic dictator, Rafael Trujillo, and Haitian President Paul Magloire signed what effectively amounted to a trade <a href=" https://biblio.flacsoandes.edu.ec/catalog/resGet.php?resId=24761 
	" target="_blank"> labour contract </a>: tens of thousands of Haitians were sold as workers by their country, to live on bateyes - small towns in the middle of sugarcane fields - where <a href=" https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ilab/ilab20130927 
	" target="_blank"> labour violations </a> such payments below the minimum wage, 12-hours work days are rampant.  </br></br>In India, <a href=" https://maptia.com/davidgoldmanphoto/stories/migrant-sugarcane-workers-of-india 
	" target="_blank"> every year at harvest season </a>, around half a million poor subsistence farmers migrate to the Maharashtra and Karnataka states where sugarcane grows. The cutters usually come with their whole family, setting up large “tent-cities.” Their wives and daughters must find new, sometimes more dangerous ways of gathering food and water; their children cannot finish their school year, and remain uneducated, perpetuating the cycle of poverty.  </br></br> And lest we forget: the original sugarcane plantations were harvested by slaves, people brought by force from Africa to Latin America, to feed the British sweet tooth.

				A quarter of the U.S.’ sugar comes from Florida’s Everglades, a large network of rivers and lakes. For years, phosphorus, a fertilizer used on sugarcane plantations, was <a href=" https://everglades.org/phosphorous/
" target="_blank"> dumped in its waters </a>, which crowded out native plants to the benefit of non-native ones and algae. Water quality has also been impaired as its salinity has changed, creating a hostile environment for the fish found there. </br></br> In Cambodia, local populations have complained of <a href=" https://ejatlas.org/conflict/blood-sugar-land-grab-by-phnom-penh-sugar-company-kampong-speu-cambodia 
" target="_blank"> waste dumping </a> from the sugar companies, making villagers sick and killing fishes. In Brazil, the practice of burning the sugarcanes - which makes it easier to harvest and allows it to regrow for the upcoming year - has been associated with <a href=" https://www.researchgate.net/publication/7106317_The_Impact_of_Sugar_Cane-Burning_Emissions_on_the_Respiratory_System_of_Children_and_the_Elderly

								Prominent NGOs have appealed to the large companies which use sugar in their products, down the supply chain: the likes of Coca Cola and Nestlé. Holding them accountable by appealing to reputational risk is a step in the right direction. Other actors can also be called to action. Cambodia’s sugar industry boomed thanks to the EBA - Everything but Arms program - which gave preferential treatment to Cambodian products in the E.U. market. The U.S. Department of Labor reported on the labour violations in the Dominican Republic in 2013, though nothing came of it. Individual governments and the international community have the power to push for sustainable change along the sugar supply chain.
